# README

A simple application to display weather information from OpenWeather API. Displays weather from a city or from a random coordinate.

### Things to improve

- Support unit switch directly from the interface (in progress)
- Support searching for coordinates (the backend is ready, but needs frontend implementation)
- Handle better on the interface some information not being available (like visibility, or humidity)
- Test the controllers and the interface with capybara
